            <p>Hello! My name is Cristobal Henriquez but you can call me Cris or Tobal. I’ve never been good with these introductions because I consider myself quite boring (Its not a bad thing to be boring) aha! I’m blessed to be sealed to my best friend and growing our little family (2, and 3 year olds). I am in the midst of a career change from working skilled trades (construction) to software development, my long term goal is to specialize in machine learning & AI development. I enjoy reading, when the time permits (but there’s never time!). </p>
